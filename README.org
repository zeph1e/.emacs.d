* .emacs.d

This repository contains the emacs configuration currently I'm using. It is being written to make emacs be fits to my taste but all or some parts of this might be useful to you if you're a C++ developer.

* Prerequisite

 - git / mercurial to download packages
 - gnuplot, the graphing utility
 - nodejs / npm for web-beautify
 - markdown for markdown-preview
 - ImageMagick for plantuml-mode and screenshot

** Emacs and Git version

If you're willing to use emacs 24.4 or later, magit 2.X will be installed and it doesn't work with earlier version of git. You need to install git version 1.9.4 or later. Otherwise, if you're stuck with emacs version 24.3 or earlier, magit 1.X will be installd and the git version will not make a problem.

Anyway I'm using emacs version 24.3 and (mainly) 24.5. Since tested version is so limited, altough I'm trying to keep compatibility within emacs version 24.X, this might make a problem in other versions.

Version 23 is not supported, completely. Why don't you move your heavy asses to later version?

** Compiler

Because I only use gcc for these days, I wrote some stuffs in gcc working manner. If you're using some other compiler something, like getting compiler specific include paths, might not work.

* Installation

Try following commands on your system:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.old # backup your old emacs dot directory if you have one already
$ git clone git@github.com:zeph1e/.emacs.d.git ~/
#+END_SRC

All of rest packages are installed while launching emacs after that.

* Pacakges

I use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] as package manager. This is great one. If you're already using MELPA or ELPA, I recommend you to try [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]].
