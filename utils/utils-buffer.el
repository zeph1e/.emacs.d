This command first saves any buffers where `buffer-save-without-query' is

Optional second argument PRED determines which buffers are considered:

If PRED is t, then certain non-file buffers will also be considered.
If PRED is a zero-argument function, it indicates for each buffer whether
to consider it or not when called with that buffer current.
